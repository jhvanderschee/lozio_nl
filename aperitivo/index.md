title: Aperitivo
---

The APERITIVO is already a notion in the north of Italy, that why we now want to introduce you at l’Ozio to the ritual of the ‘pre-dinner drink and bite’. To tickle your appetite and give you the chance to socialize with friends, relax and have a little nibble before dinner. A little something to encourage you to feel hungry, to get the juices flowing, if you will, so you can fully enjoy your upcoming meal. Aperitivo should not be translated to English or Dutch. We should start saying, “Let’s go get an aperitivo” or “Prendiamo un aperitivo.”

Every day from 17:00 till 20.00 with an open buffet.
